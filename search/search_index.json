Prediction details are available for multiple methods.</p> <p>PKS type I AT domain specificities are predicted using a twenty-four amino acid signature sequence of the active site (Yadav et al., 2003), as well as with pHMMs based on the method of Minowa et al. (Minowa et al., 2007), which is also used to predict co-enzyme A ligase domain specificities. NRPS A domain specificities are predicted using both the signature sequence method and the support-vector machines-based method of NRPSPredictor2 (Rausch et al., 2005 &amp; R\u00f6ttig et al., 2011), and the method of Minowa et al.
