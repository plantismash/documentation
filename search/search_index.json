A stand-alone version of plantiSMASH is available from the download page . Why doesn't plantiSMASH detect my gene cluster? # Some gene clusters, such as cofactor biosynthesis gene clusters are not identified by plantiSMASH, as they are categorized as primary metabolism instead of secondary metabolism. If you are aware of a true secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster that escapes detection by antiSMASH, please contact us, and we will add the models necessary to detect it. Why are several genes upstream and downstream of gene clusters included, even though they do not seem to be part of the gene cluster? # In designing plantiSMASH, we tried to be very conservative in cutting gene cluster borders, leaving this to the expert eye of the user, as it is better to show some extra genes than to leave out key genes. Why is my BGC not detected in full? # The user can specify a different cutoff when running the program as a stand-alone program, by manually editing the cluster rules file, avaialble on the gitHub repository.

Recently, evidence has been accumulating that (like in microbes) the genes encoding the biosynthetic pathways towards these metabolites are often densely clustered in specific genomic loci: biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). This offers great potential for genome-based discovery of plant natural products. Here, we introduce plantiSMASH, a versatile online analysis platform that automates the identification of candidate plant BGCs, as well as their comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis. The cluster detection logic, validated on a set of all plant BGCs that have been experimentally characterized thus far, is able to pinpoint many complex metabolic loci across the Plant Kingdom. Additionally, interactively visualized coexpression analysis and comparative cluster-cluster alignment allow users to judge multiple sources of evidence for a candidate BGC to encode a group of enzymes that truly functions jointly in a biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, plantiSMASH finds coexpression correlations between candidate BGCs and genes elsewhere in the genome. Altogether, this new software provides a comprehensive toolkit for plant geneticists to further explore the nature of gene clustering in plant metabolism. Moreover, spurred by the continuing decrease in costs of plant genome sequencing and assembly, it will soon allow natural product chemists to apply genome mining technologies to the discovery of novel medicinal compounds from a wide range of plant species.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"intro/#introduction","text":"Plants around the globe produce a wide variety of specialized metabolites that play key roles in communication and defense.

If you are just interested in running antiSMASH for yourself, you might not need this. Feel free to skip to the guide on submitting antiSMASH jobs . Recently, we have switched the whole setup to run in docker containers. Make sure you have a reasonably recent install of docker. This guide explains how to run the whole antiSMASH web service stack on a single machine. Larger production setups will be more complicated. Note that it's trivial to wrap this whole setup in a docker-compose file, but I'm running the appropriate commands via the docker CLI for increased flexibility. Overview # There are multiple components involved in running the antiSMASH webservice. Web App # The webapp is what the users interact with in their browsers. It is responsible for starting jobs, displaying the status of running jobs, and showing the results of completed jobs. Provided by the antismash/websmash image. Job Queue # The job queue is taking care of tracking everything concerning jobs. It is run on a Redis server. Provided by the redis image. antiSMASH instances # Individual jobs are run using the antiSMASH main executable. This is wrapped by a job runner that knows how to retrieve new jobs from the job queue, and how to pick the correct parameters depending on the user input. Provided by the antismash/runsmash-lite container. Job Status Monitor # Not shown on the schema, not absolutely required, but really nice to have is the status monitor tool that will make sure the web app can display the latest available status. Also provided by the antismash/runsmash-lite container. Shared setup # The web app, job runners and the status monitor need to have access to a shared directory. In this example, we will provide it on the host. In a more complex multi-host setup, you will want to put this on a shared filesystem. In all the below setups, the shared directory will be called /data/antismash/upload . If you are using a different directory, adjust accordingly. Setting up the job queue # This is straightforward and using the off the shelf redis image available on the docker hub. Run it using docker run --name antismash-redis redis . Setting up the antiSMASH job runner(s) # This step requires more work. First, set up the PFAM and ClusterBlast databases as described for the standalone-lite image .

You can either upload a local GenBank/EMBL file manually, or simply enter the GenBank/RefSeq accession number of your sequence for plantiSMASH to upload it. You can toggle the option in the \"Data input\" panel where default is the accession number entry where antiSMASH will attempt to download the data directly from NCBI. In case no gene annotations are available for your sequence, we recommend running your sequence through an annotation pipeline like RAST to obtain GBK/EMBL files with high-quality annotations. Alternatively, you can provide a FASTA file containing a single sequence. In that case, antiSMASH will generate a preliminary annotation using Prodigal, and use that to run the rest of the analysis. You can also provide gene annotations in GFF3 format. In any case, it is very important that input files are properly formatted. If you are creating your GBK/EMBL/FASTA file manually, be sure to do so in a plain text editor like Notepad or Emacs, and saving your files as \"All files ( . )\", ending with the correct extension (for example \".fasta\", \".gbk\", or \".embl\". plantiSMASH default and extra features # Before pressing the submission button, you will have to indicate which antiSMASH features you like to run.

ClusterBlast analysis : the identified clusters are searched against a comprehensive gene cluster database and similar clusters are identified. The algorithm used here is inspired by MultiGeneBlast . It runs BlastP using each amino acid sequence from a detected gene cluster as a query on a large database of predicted protein sequences from secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, and pools the results to identify the gene clusters that are most homologous to the gene cluster that was detected in your query nucleotide sequence. Enabling this option will increase the runtime of a submission. Cluster Pfam analysis : each gene product encoded in the detected BGCs is analyzed against the PFAM database . Hits are annotated in the final Genbank/EMBL files that can be downloaded after the analysis is finished. Please note that these results are not displayed on the antiSMASH HTML results page but they are present in the results genbank file that can be downloaded.

Similarity percentage # Similarity in the description, e.g. 87% of genes show similarity , is the percentage of genes within the reference that have a hit to any genes in the query. As gene hits are not required to be 100% identity and query genes may hit multiple reference genes, this total similarity percentage is no guarantee that the region is exactly the same. In the case of KnownClusterBlast, this also means that there is no guarantee that the compound(s) recorded for that MIBiG entry will be produce by the region. Even if 100% of genes have a hit for a reference, it may be less relevant than a lower similarity. Some cluster types, e.g. NRPS clusters, may only need a few aminos changed in gene translations to have a completely different product. In all cases, manual verification is required before assuming that the region produces the same compound as the reference. Example 1: low similarity, good match # Reference area R has 70% of genes showing similarity to the query region Q . All genes with hits are very high identity in their hits, at 95% or higher. The missing genes from R are all at one end of the reference area. These genes are also present in the genome antiSMASH was run on, but are outside Q due to the size of R being exceptionally large. After manually checking these extra genes and seeing that they're similar to the missing genes, it's much, much more likely that the genome matches the reference. Example 2: perfect similarity, poor match # Reference area R has 100% of genes showing similarity to the query region Q . None of the genes have a percentage identity in individual hits greater than 60%. While it is still possible that Q produces the same compound as R , it will depend a great deal on the type of cluster and exactly which parts of the genes are similar. Example 3: high similarity, poor match # Reference area R has very high (but not 100%) similarity, with all but one gene in R having similarity to genes in the query region Q . All of the matching genes have very high identity in their hits. The gene in R that is missing in Q should be in the middle of Q and is a core gene responsible for the scaffold of the compound.

Following that is a table with a summary of each region found in the record, with each row ( 5 ) having the following fields: Region : the region number Type : the product types as detected by antiSMASH (clicking the types will take you to their description in these help pages) From , To : the location of the region (in nucleotides) Most similar known cluster : the closest compound from the MiBIG database (clicking this will take you to the MiBIG entry), along with its type (e.g. t1pks+t3pks ) Similarity : a percentage of genes within the closest known compound that have a significant BLAST hit to genes within the current region The last two columns containing comparisons to the MiBIG database will only be shown if antiSMASH was run with the KnownClusterBlast option. Clicking anywhere in the row that is not already an external link will take you to the detailed results for that region.","title":"Overview page"},{"location":"understanding_output/regions/","text":"The antiSMASH region concept # Currently, there is no good method available to accurately predict gene cluster borders based purely on the submitted sequence data (with the exception of the CASSIS algorithm, which is able to detect co-regulated genes in fungal genomes). In antiSMASH5, the display of gene clusters change to reflect the fact that the BGC borders are just offsets defined in the cluster detection rules, we renamed the highest level that is displayed to \u201cRegion\u201d. A region in antiSMASH 5 and above corresponds to the gene cluster annotation in antiSMASH 4 and earlier. How are antiSMASH regions defined? # In the first step, all gene products of the analyzed sequence are searched against a database of highly conserved enzyme HMM profiles (core-enzymes), which are indicative of a specific BGC type. In a second step, pre-defined cluster rules are employed to define individual protoclusters encoded in the region. These make up a core , which is extended by its neighbourhood , which constiutes of genes encoded up- and downstream of the core . Here is an example of a rule for detecting a protocluster for a type I PKS: Whenever antiSMASH finds a gene coding for a protein that has as PKS_AT domain and a PKS_KS domain of various sub-types, a new \u201cType I PKS protocluster \u201d feature is generated within the region; this feature comprises the core gene-product(s) that trigger the rule (i.e. the PKS encoding genes and extends the neighborhood to the left and right of the core genes by 20 kb to the left and right (as defined by the EXTENT parameter in the rule definition). The values for the different cluster types are empirically determined and generally tend to overpredict, i.e. included also adjacent genes. After the protocluster features are assigned (note: there can be multiple protocluster features within a single region ), they are checked for overlaps (as defined by the CUTOFF parameter) and are grouped into several types of candidate clusters to reflect the observation that many BGCs actually comprise several classes of biosynthetic machinery. For example glycopeptides like vancomycin or balhimycin (shown) are synthesized via NRPS, but also contain a type III PKS as a precursor pathway. Thus, the displayed region contains the NRPS protocluster (green bar) and a T3PKS protocluster (yellow bar). As their neighbourhoods overlap, they are assigned to a candidate cluster . Candidate cluster types # Chemical hybrid # These candidate clusters contains protoclusters which share cluster-defining CDS/genes/gene products. They will also include protoclusters within that shared range that do not share a CDS, provided that they are completely contained within the supercluster border. For example, case A in the image above. In the example, CDS 1 and 2 define the protocluster of type A, and CDS 2 and 4 define the protocluster of type B. Since both protoclusters share a CDS that defines those protoclusters, a chemical hybrid candidate cluster is created. If CDS 4 and some later CDS were also contributing to a third protocluster type, it would be merged into this same candidate cluster. If CDS 3 defined another protocluster which did not extend past CDS 1 or 4, then that new protocluster would also be included in the chemical hybrid, under the assumption that it is relevant to the other protoclusters. Interleaved # These candidate clusters contain protoclusters which do not share cluster-defining CDS features, but their core locations overlap, e.g. case B in the image above. \u2003 Neighbouring # These candidate clusters are the weakest form of hybrid candidates. They contain protoclusters which do not match either chemical or interleaved variants, but transitively overlap in their neighbourhoods. Every protocluster in a \"neighbouring candidate cluster\" will also belong to one of the other kinds of candidate clusters, including the single kind, described below, excepting cases where it would be a single candidate and have the exact coordinates of the neighbouring candidate cluster. Single # This kind of candidate clusters exists where only one protocluster is contained, e.g. case D . It exists only for internal consistency. A single candidate cluster will not exist for a protocluster which is contained in either a chemical hybrid or an interleaved candidate cluster, but will exist for each inside a neighbouring candidate. For example, both protoclusters in case C will have an independent single candidate, along with the neighbouring .","title":"Region concept"},{"location":"understanding_output/regions/#the-antismash-region-concept","text":"Currently, there is no good method available to accurately predict gene cluster borders based purely on the submitted sequence data (with the exception of the CASSIS algorithm, which is able to detect co-regulated genes in fungal genomes).
