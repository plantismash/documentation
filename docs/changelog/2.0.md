<h3>Major</h3>

<h4>Expanded BGC Detection Rules</h4>

plantiSMASH version 2 introduces updated and additional biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) detection rules, significantly expanding the frameworkâ€™s ability to identify specialized metabolic pathways in plant genomes. These improvements:

* Broaden the range of detectable cluster types.
* Increase accuracy in gene grouping and cluster boundary prediction.
* Enable detection of newly characterized biosynthetic gene families.

<h4>Substrate Prediction</h4>

This version adds substrate specificity prediction for selected enzyme families, providing functional insight into the metabolic products of plant BGCs. Features include:

* Prediction of likely substrates based on sequence motifs and known biochemistry.
* Integration of substrate information in cluster output and visualizations.
* Enhanced interpretability of BGC functions and potential products.

<h4>Regulatory Feature Detection</h4>

plantiSMASH 2 enhances regulatory analysis by predicting transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in the promoter regions of BGC-associated genes. This new functionality:

* Leverages known plant TFBS motif libraries.
* Identifies putative regulatory elements linked to biosynthetic gene expression.
* Facilitates hypotheses about coordinated gene regulation within clusters.
