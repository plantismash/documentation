# Understanding plantiSMASH Output

Currently, there is no good method available to accurately predict gene cluster
borders based purely on the submitted sequence data. Accordingly, plantiSMASH predicts
[regions of interest](regions.md) on the input genomes.

The [overview page](overview.md) contains a summary of all regions found in all
records/contigs within the input given to antiSMASH. Every region is described in more
detail in its [region results page](results.md).
