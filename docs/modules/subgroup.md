## Subgroup identification module

plantiSMASH predicts substrate specificities of enzyme subfamilies for cellulose synthases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, short-chain dehydrogenases, and oxidosqualene cyclases, using pplacer and hmmer. The phylogenetic placement tool pplacer is used to place the target protein sequence on a precomputed reference tree. If the other members under the target parent node belong to the same subgroup, the target is considered to belong to the subgroup. In addition, GraPhlAn (Graphical Phylogenetic Analysis) is used to generate a tree image of the placement result. The HMM of each subgroup used by hmmer scan is made based on the full-length protein sequences of members in the subgroup. HMMs find matches based on the conserved positions of subgroup members, so they are also an efficient and simple method to identify subgroups of targets, especially those sequences with big differences. When the subgroup represented by the HMM with the highest match bitscore is consistent with the results from pplacer, it will be reported on the overview page that the target may have the same substrate type as those members of the subgroup. If it belongs to the product type that is predicted by the existence of core enzymes, it is specifically marked with * . For situations where the results of these two tools are inconsistent, or the target is not placed in a subgroup, users need to make their judgment based on results shown on the webpage of each cluster.
